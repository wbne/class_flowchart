# class_flowchart
fun way to visualize prereqs, courses left, grade distributions, and more

notes:
you have to load your own data in the json files in the specified format. if you do not have access to the grades/prereqs (how?!) then this website cannot help.
it is really just a tool to SEE the classes left and the prereqs needed. also funny nodes go brrrrr
